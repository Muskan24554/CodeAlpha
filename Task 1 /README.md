## Introduction
An interactive Power BI dashboard was developed to monitor e-commerce performance across revenue, profitability, order volume, products, customers, and regions, enabling rapid drill‑downs with slicers and clear KPI callouts for stakeholders. 

The layout applies KPI cards for instant status, plus segmented visuals for deeper analysis and comparison across periods

## KPIs (Key Performance Indicators)

Total Sales, Total Profit, Total Orders, and Average Order Value (AOV) are displayed as KPI cards for fast status recognition and goal tracking.

YoY Growth and YTD metrics for Sales/Profit to contextualize performance over time and seasonality.

Top Products/Customers/Regions contribute to concentrate commercial focus where the impact is highest

## Project Objective
Deliver a single, interactive view in Power BI that tracks sales, profit, orders, and AOV across time, product, customer, and region to support fast, data‑driven decisions.

Quantify performance with YTD and YoY measures, surface seasonality, and identify top/bottom contributors at product, sub‑category, and geography levels for targeted actions.

Enable business exploration with slicers for period, region, category, and channel, keeping the layout simple, performant, and presentation‑ready for stakeholders.

Provide actionable diagnostics—high return/cancel items, margin drivers, and customer/payment behaviors—to prioritize pricing, promotion, assortment, and fulfillment improvements.

## Project Insights
Clear seasonality in monthly profit with identifiable peak and trough months that inform inventory and marketing planning.

Category and sub‑category splits reveal where quantity and profit diverge, guiding assortment and pricing actions for margin lift.

State and payment‑mode analysis surfaces high‑value regions and preferred payment behaviors useful for promotions and checkout optimization.

Top customers and products drive a disproportionate share of sales, supporting targeted retention and cross‑sell strategies.
